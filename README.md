# CIFAR-10 Classification with Fastai

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using the Fastai library. The project showcases the power of Fastai in simplifying the process of building, training, and evaluating a deep learning model for a common image classification task.

## Introduction

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a fundamental dataset for computer vision research, containing 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes. This project leverages the Fastai library to efficiently train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in classifying images into their respective categories.

## Installation

To run this notebook, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed on your machine. Additionally, the Fastai library needs to be installed. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installing the necessary dependencies, you can start the Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab server:

```
jupyter notebook
```

or

```
jupyter lab
```

Then, navigate to the `classifying-cifar-dataset-understanding-learner.ipynb` notebook and open it. You can run the notebook cells sequentially to download the dataset, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
